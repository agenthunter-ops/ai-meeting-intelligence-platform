## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Context:** Choosing the overall architecture pattern for the AI Meeting Intelligence Platform

#### Decision
We chose a **hybrid microservices architecture** with the following services:
- Backend API Service (FastAPI)
- Whisper Transcription Service (gRPC)
- LLM Analysis Service (FastAPI)
- Vector Database Service (ChromaDB)
- Static Frontend Service (Nginx)

#### Rationale
```python
# Architecture benefits analysis
architecture_benefits = {
    "microservices_advantages": [
        "Independent scaling of AI-intensive services",
        "Technology diversity (Python, gRPC, Vector DB)",
        "Fault isolation between critical services", 
        "Team autonomy for different service domains",
        "Easier deployment and rollback strategies"
    ],
    "monolithic_disadvantages": [
        "Single point of failure for entire system",
        "Difficult to scale AI services independently",
        "Technology lock-in for entire application",
        "Complex deployment of large AI models",
        "Resource contention between services"
    ],
    "hybrid_approach_benefits": [
        "Reduced network latency for core operations",
        "Simplified authentication/authorization",
        "Easier development for small team",
        "Cost-effective for MVP deployment"
    ]
}
```

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Better scalability, fault isolation, technology choice flexibility
- **Negative:** Increased complexity in deployment, inter-service communication overhead
- **Mitigation:** Docker Compose orchestration, comprehensive monitoring, circuit breakers

### ADR-002: SQLite vs PostgreSQL for Development

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2024-01-16  
**Context:** Database choice for development vs production environments

#### Decision
Use **SQLite for development** and **PostgreSQL for production** with abstracted database layer.

#### Implementation
```python
# backend/db.py - Database abstraction implementation
class DatabaseConfig:
    """Database configuration that adapts to environment."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_engine_config(database_url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get database engine configuration based on URL."""
        
        if database_url.startswith("sqlite"):
            return {
                "connect_args": {
                    "check_same_thread": False,
                    "timeout": 20,
                    "isolation_level": None,
                },
                "pool_pre_ping": False,
                "echo": False
            }
        else:  # PostgreSQL
            return {
                "connect_args": {},
                "pool_size": 20,
                "max_overflow": 0,
                "pool_pre_ping": True,
                "echo": False
            }
    
    @staticmethod
    def apply_optimizations(engine, database_url: str):
        """Apply database-specific optimizations."""
        
        with engine.connect() as conn:
            if database_url.startswith("sqlite"):
                # SQLite optimizations
                conn.execute(text("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL"))
                conn.execute(text("PRAGMA cache_size=-64000"))
                conn.execute(text("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON"))
            else:
                # PostgreSQL optimizations
                conn.execute(text("SET statement_timeout = '300s'"))
                conn.execute(text("SET lock_timeout = '30s'"))
```

#### Benefits
- **Development:** Fast setup, no external dependencies, easy testing
- **Production:** ACID compliance, advanced features, horizontal scaling
- **Portability:** Same ORM code works across both databases

### ADR-003: Angular vs Static HTML Frontend

**Status:** ACCEPTED (REVISED)  
**Date:** 2024-01-20  
**Context:** Frontend framework choice after Angular build issues

#### Original Decision: Angular
Initially chose Angular for rich SPA experience with TypeScript benefits.

#### Revised Decision: Static HTML + Vanilla JavaScript
After encountering persistent Angular build issues and version conflicts, pivoted to static HTML approach.

#### Implementation Strategy
```html
<!-- Static HTML with modern JavaScript patterns -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>AI Meeting Intelligence Platform</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Component-based architecture using vanilla JS -->
    <div id="app">
        <div id="dashboard-component" class="hidden"></div>
        <div id="upload-component" class="hidden"></div>
        <div id="search-component" class="hidden"></div>
    </div>
    
    <script>
        // Modern JavaScript with ES6+ features
        class ComponentManager {
            constructor() {
                this.components = new Map();
                this.state = new Proxy({}, {
                    set: (target, property, value) => {
                        target[property] = value;
                        this.notifyComponents(property, value);
                        return true;
                    }
                });
            }
            
            register(name, component) {
                this.components.set(name, component);
            }
            
            notifyComponents(property, value) {
                for (const [name, component] of this.components) {
                    if (component.onStateChange) {
                        component.onStateChange(property, value);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Benefits of Revised Approach
- **Reliability:** No build tools, no dependency conflicts
- **Performance:** Faster loading, smaller bundle size
- **Maintainability:** Simpler debugging, fewer abstractions
- **Deployment:** Static file serving, CDN-friendly

### ADR-004: Ollama vs External LLM APIs

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2024-01-18  
**Context:** LLM service architecture for AI analysis

#### Decision
Use **Ollama for local LLM deployment** instead of external APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic).

#### Technical Implementation
```python
# llm_service/ollama_client.py - Local LLM integration
class OllamaLLMService:
    """Local LLM service using Ollama."""
    
    def __init__(self, base_url: str = "http://ollama:11434"):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.models = {
            "analysis": "llama2:7b",
            "summarization": "llama2:7b", 
            "chat": "llama2:7b-chat"
        }
        self.model_cache = {}
    
    async def ensure_model_loaded(self, model_name: str):
        """Ensure model is loaded and ready."""
        
        if model_name not in self.model_cache:
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                # Pull model if not available
                response = await client.post(
                    f"{self.base_url}/api/pull",
                    json={"name": model_name}
                )
                
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    self.model_cache[model_name] = True
                    logger.info(f"Model {model_name} ready")
    
    async def generate_completion(self, prompt: str, model_task: str = "analysis") -> str:
        """Generate completion using local LLM."""
        
        model_name = self.models.get(model_task, self.models["analysis"])
        await self.ensure_model_loaded(model_name)
        
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=120.0) as client:
            payload = {
                "model": model_name,
                "prompt": prompt,
                "stream": False,
                "options": {
                    "temperature": 0.1,
                    "top_p": 0.9,
                    "num_predict": 2048
                }
            }
            
            response = await client.post(
                f"{self.base_url}/api/generate",
                json=payload
            )
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                result = response.json()
                return result.get("response", "").strip()
            else:
                raise Exception(f"LLM generation failed: {response.text}")
```

#### Strategic Benefits
- **Privacy:** No data leaves local infrastructure
- **Cost:** No per-token pricing, unlimited usage
- **Latency:** Local processing, no external API calls
- **Reliability:** No dependency on external service uptime
- **Customization:** Ability to fine-tune models for meeting domain

## Technical Interview Preparation

### Deep Dive Question Bank

```python
# Technical interview preparation for system architecture
technical_qa_bank = {
    "system_architecture": [
        {
            "question": "Why did you choose microservices over a monolithic architecture?",
            "answer": """
            We chose microservices for several key reasons:
            
            1. **Independent Scaling**: AI services (Whisper, LLM) have different resource requirements
            2. **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use optimal technology (gRPC for audio, FastAPI for APIs)
            3. **Fault Isolation**: If one AI service fails, the rest of the system continues functioning
            4. **Development Velocity**: Team can work independently on different services
            5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Can update AI models without touching the core API
            
            The trade-offs are increased complexity and network latency, which we mitigate with:
            - Docker Compose for simplified local development
            - Service mesh for production communication
            - Comprehensive health checks and monitoring

        },
        {
            "question": "How do you handle consistency across distributed services?",
            "answer": """
            We implement eventual consistency with event-driven architecture:
            
            1. **Event Bus**: Redis pub/sub for service communication
            2. **Saga Pattern**: For multi-service transactions (upload -> transcribe -> analyze)
            3. **Idempotency**: All API operations are idempotent with unique request IDs
            4. **Compensating Actions**: Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
            5. **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data domain
            
            Example: Upload creates meeting record, publishes event, Whisper service processes,
            publishes transcription complete event, LLM service analyzes, updates meeting status.
