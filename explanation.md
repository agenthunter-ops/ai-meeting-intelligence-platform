# AI Meeting Intelligence Platform - Technical Mastery Guide

## Project Overview
The AI Meeting Intelligence Platform transforms meeting audio into actionable insights using local AI processing. Built with microservices architecture for enterprise scalability.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Static HTML + JavaScript (eliminates Angular complexity)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async processing
- **AI Services**: Whisper (speech-to-text) + Ollama (LLM analysis)  
- **Data**: PostgreSQL + Redis + ChromaDB (vector search)
- **Processing**: Celery workers for background tasks

## Data Flow
1. **Upload**: File validation → Secure storage → Task queue
2. **Processing**: Audio → Whisper → Text analysis → LLM insights
3. **Storage**: Database + Vector embeddings + Cache
4. **Retrieval**: Real-time status + Semantic search

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Static HTML over Angular?
- Eliminated build complexity and version conflicts
- Faster loading, easier debugging
- Production-ready without Node.js issues
- Reduced security attack surface

### Why FastAPI?
- 3x faster than Flask
- Automatic API docs
- Built-in validation
- Native async support

### Why Local AI?
- Complete privacy (no data leaves infrastructure)  
- No per-request costs
- Consistent performance
- Compliance-ready

## Technology Stack Justification

**Backend**: FastAPI chosen for performance (65k req/sec vs Flask's 20k)
**Database**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance + JSONB flexibility  
**Queue**: Celery + Redis for reliable background processing
**AI**: Whisper + Ollama for state-of-the-art local processing
**Search**: ChromaDB for semantic vector search

## Security Implementation
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- File validation (type, size, signature)
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- CORS protection and rate limiting
- Audit logging for compliance

## Scalability Strategy
- Microservices for independent scaling
- Horizontal Celery worker scaling  
- Database read replicas
- Redis clustering
- Docker + Kubernetes ready

## Performance Optimizations
- Async processing pipeline
- Database query optimization
- Redis caching strategy
- File chunking for large audio
- Connection pooling

## Error Handling & Recovery
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Dead letter queue for failed tasks
- Comprehensive health checks
- Automated recovery procedures

## Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Real-time performance dashboards
- Alert system for failures
- Distributed tracing
